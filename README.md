TODO:
    [ ] Transitioning away from the SDL lazyfoo tutorial and working
        on Pikuma tutorial

        _____ START HERE______
        [ ] Pikuma: Uncapped framerate chapter is next
        [ ] Get back to where you left off
            [x] implement delta time
            [ ] clean up delta time stuff (print message)

        [ ] Networking layer maybe? - basic client server tcp/udp transfering
            once I get to the sprites being animated, I want to created
            a networked app which will just use a click to spawn a moving cat

            this will run on two diff computers over a network and will update the cats on both sides

    [ ] Update UML Diagram
