Basic ECS Design:

    - Entitys:
        - Player, enemy, anything which houses some data.  
        - Doesnt need a graphical representation:
            - for example, a door trigger event could be an entity which just has a collider

    - Components:
        - Collider, transform, Mesh renderer
        - Things you add to entities to make them logical

    - An entity has a list of components.  When you call Entity::Update() it iterates
        through all the components and calls their Component::update() (virtual) functions
        Same with rendering

    - Entities need to register with some system that governs them.  probably the app class
